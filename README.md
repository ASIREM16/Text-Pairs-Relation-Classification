## CNN for Chinese Text Classification in Tensorflow

Sentiment classification forked from [dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf](https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf), make the data helper supports Chinese language (Use `gensim` package) and modified the network (Based on my task).

**[This code belongs to the "Implementing a CNN for Text Classification in Tensorflow" blog post.](http://www.wildml.com/2015/12/implementing-a-cnn-for-text-classification-in-tensorflow/)**

It is slightly simplified implementation of Kim's [Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882) paper in Tensorflow.

## Requirements

- Python 3.5
- Tensorflow 1.0.0
- Numpy
- Gensim
