## CNN for Chinese Text Classification in Tensorflow

This project is used by my Graduation Design, and it is also a study of TensorFlow, familiar with CNN, RNN and other neural networks.

The main objective of the project is to determine whether the two are similar (two classification problems) by the given two sentences. 

The project refer to [dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf](https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf), make the data helper supports Chinese language (Task required) and modified the network structure(Based on my task).

## Requirements

- Python 3.4.x
- Tensorflow 1.0.0
- Numpy
- Gensim

## Data

Research data may attract copyright protection under China law. Thus, there is only code.

实验数据属于实验室与某公司的合作项目，涉及商业机密，在此不予提供，还望谅解。

## Pre-trained Word Vectors

Use `gensim` package to pre-train my data.
